# buf.yamls can refer to multiple modules.
#
# Module files are available to other modules in a similar manner as they are with workspaces
# today.
modules:
  - path: books
    name: buf.build/emcfarlane/books
  - path: googleapis
    name: buf.build/emcfarlane/googleapis
# Dependencies are shared between all modules.
#
# There's a single buf.lock for the buf.yaml, all modules represented by the buf.yaml
# share the same dependency set.
#
# This all enables things like "workspace push".
#
# Note that for unused import detection, we will need to change the logic to make sure that
# an import is not used by ANY module in the buf.yaml, not just the module being built.
#
# It is an error to have a module as a dep that is also a named module in the modules list.
deps:
  # Without federation, do we enforce that all deps are from the same hostname as the modules?
